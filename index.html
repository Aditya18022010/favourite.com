            <p id="bio_1">There are many dance forms, such as Ballet dance, Tap dance, Jazz dance, Ballroom dance, Hip-hop dance, and many more, but Hip-Hop dance is my favourite form of dance. I picked up dancing as my hobby as it presents me with a platform to explore the happiness of my life and connect to my soul.
                <br>
                <br>
            <p id="bio_2">Dance as a hobby is almost like finding a new person inside you. ... Practice certainly makes a person skilled in any field and this holds good for dance too. It is important to dedicate some time for practice as certain steps require practice. Dance is a form of exercise that also is a great feel good factor.
                While dancing all you need are comfortable shoes and clothes. ... They dance with me so that I can dance and take my hobby forward. I never dance in the same style but I like to mix up everything. I know many types of dancing such as tap, modern, hip hop, contemporary and western.</p>
            <p id="bio_3">
                Dancing can be a way to stay fit for people of all ages, shapes and sizes. It has a wide range of physical and mental benefits including: improved condition of your heart and lungs. increased muscular strength, endurance and motor fitness.One thing which is important is you have to enjoy your dance. I dance because it makes me confident and I enjoy dancing.
